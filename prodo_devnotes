Dev notes for my todo list python project

GOAL: Make a todo list program with varius QoL features such as
- Ability to make different todo lists for differing tasks(Simple grocery list, project to do list with deadline, todo list with sublist)
- Set deadline for tasks and show time left on items of a list that have a dealine
- Be able to set status for items and lists
- Build up GUI to support these features

# Ideas:
# When initializing a listpad, automatically add in time and date of creation
# Ability to set deadline for individual tasks 
# Make a listpad and set a deadline for it where all tasks would need to be completed before the "todo" list is considered complete (useful for projects with clearly defined steps necessary to complete)


Data Structure of Todo lists:
  Todo object:
    Status variable (symbolic value that will identify status of a task)
    Detail variable (String that details what a task is)
    Due variable (Optional; a date that will be used to show the deadline or used to show time left on task that are assigned a value to this)

    time_left property: will store time difference between due date and when the current day that time left is checked

    Change Status method:
      Allows the changing of the status of a task between
      Incomplete/In progress/Completed
      W/ symbols (o/-/x)
      In GUI will have a button to set status as in progress. Default status will be incomplete.

    Change Detail method:
      Allows changing of the descriptive string of a task
      Should not allow empty task/string
      Will be limiterd to a certain amount of characters

    Change Due date method:
      Accepts a valid date to act as deadline for a certain task
      Will help with checking for time left

    Check time left method:
      Will display the time left from the day checked to when a task is due and compute time left and report it in a readable way.

    Get method for: Status, Detail, Due


  Pad object:
    Data structure containing all Todo objects
      Current idea: A whole pad object will contain a dictionary of todo objects with a task key assigned per task objects
    Variable for name of the the Pad
    Variable of total number of tasks
    Variable of completd tasks
    (Optional) Variable for deadline

    __del__ method:
      Easy removal of a task and deduction of total task
